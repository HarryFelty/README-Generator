## Description
This project was created to provide users with a quick way to generate a REAME for any project. This applicaiton solves the problem of writing multiple README files from scratch. During this project, I learned about and gained experience with various technologies. These include Nodejs as well as modules such as Inquirer and filesystem (fs).
